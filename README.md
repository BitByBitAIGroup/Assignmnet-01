To design a graph search agent and understand the use of a hash table, queue in state space search. In this lab, we need prior knowledge of the types of agents involved and use this knowledge to solve a puzzle called 8- puzzle.

Problem Statements --

A) - Write a pseudocode for a graph search agent. Represent the agent in the form of a flow chart. Clearly mention all the implementation details with reasons. B) - Write a collection of functions imitating the environment for Puzzle-8. C) - Describe what is Iterative Deepening Search. D) - Considering the cost associated with every move to be the same (uniform cost), write a function which can backtrack and produce the path taken to reach the goal state from the source/ initial state. E) - Generate Puzzle-8 instances with the goal state at depth “d”. F) - Prepare a table indicating the memory and time requirements to solve Puzzle-8 instances (depth “d”) using your graph search agent
